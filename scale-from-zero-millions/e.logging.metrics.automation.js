    You can monitor logs @ per server level or use tools to aggregate them to a centralized service for easy search and viewing


Metrics:
    Collecting different types of metrics help us to gain business insights and understand the health status of the system. 
    Some of the following metrics are useful
        i.   Host level metrics: CPU, memory, disk i/o etc
        ii.  Aggregasted level metrics: performance of the entire db tier, cache tier 
        iii. Key business metrics: daily active user, rentention, revenue.
        
        

Automation:
    When system get bigger and complex, we need to build or leverage automation tools to improve productivity. 
    Continuous integration is a good practice, in which each code check- in is verified throguh automation, allowing teams to detect problems earkly.
    Besides, automating your build, test, deploy process, etc could improve developer productivity significantly.



As the data grows every data, your database get more overloaded. it's time to scale the data tier.
