Database Scalling:
There are two broad approaches for db scalling,i.e vertical scalling and horizontal scalling.


Vertical Scalling:
    Also known as scalling up, by adding more CPU, Ram, Disk etc to an exisitng machine. There are some powerful database servers. 

Howerver, vertical scalling comes wioth some serious drawbacks:
i. You can add more CPU, RAM, etc to your db server. but there are hardware limits. If you have a large user base single server is not enough.
ii. Greater risk of single point of failure
iii. The overall cost of vertical scaling is high. Powerful servers are much more expensive.




Horizontal Scalling:
Horizontal scalling also known as sharding is the practice of adding more servers.

Sharding separates large database into smaller, more easily managed shards. Each shards shares the same schema, though the acutal data on each shard is unique to the shard
